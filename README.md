# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the open-source textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This comprehensive resource bridges the gap between digital AI and physical embodiment, focusing on how AI systems can function in the real world through humanoid robots.

## Overview

This textbook covers the essential concepts needed to understand and develop AI systems for humanoid robots. The content is structured around a practical curriculum that guides students from fundamental robotics concepts to advanced AI integration.

### Focus and Theme
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Understanding how intelligence emerges from the interaction between brain, body, and environment
- **Physical AI**: AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Design, simulation, and deployment of robots capable of natural human interactions

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- ROS 2 architecture: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Bridging Python agents to ROS controllers
- URDF for humanoid robot description

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering with Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for perception and navigation
- Path planning for bipedal movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Integration of LLMs with robotics
- Voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive planning with natural language

## Technical Implementation

This textbook uses modern web technologies:

- **Framework**: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for documentation
- **Language**: TypeScript (configuration), MDX (content)
- **Math Support**: LaTeX equations rendered with `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js for system architecture diagrams
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Undergraduate/Graduate Engineering Students
- Robotics researchers and practitioners
- AI/ML engineers interested in embodied intelligence
- Anyone curious about the intersection of AI and robotics
