# Course Overview: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## The Evolution of Robotics Education

Traditional robotics education has focused on isolated components: kinematics, dynamics, control theory, and perception as separate subjects. This textbook takes a different approach, integrating these elements through the lens of **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

## Quarter-at-a-Glance

This 13-week capstone quarter is structured to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced AI integration:

### Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of humanoid robotics landscape
- Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

### Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management

### Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
- Gazebo simulation environment setup
- URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Physics simulation and sensor simulation
- Introduction to Unity for robot visualization

### Weeks 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
- NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim
- AI-powered perception and manipulation
- Reinforcement learning for robot control
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

### Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development
- Humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- Bipedal locomotion and balance control
- Manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands
- Natural human-robot interaction design

### Week 13: Conversational Robotics
- Integrating GPT models for conversational AI in robots
- Speech recognition and natural language understanding
- Multi-modal interaction: speech, gesture, vision

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this quarter, students will be able to:

1. **Understand Physical AI principles** and how embodiment affects intelligence
2. **Master ROS 2** for sophisticated robotic control and communication
3. **Simulate complex robots** using Gazebo and Unity
4. **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac** for AI-powered robotics
5. **Design humanoid robots** for natural human interactions
6. **Integrate LLMs** for conversational robotics applications

## Technical Challenges Addressed

This course specifically addresses the computational demands at the intersection of:
- Physics Simulation (Isaac Sim/Gazebo)
- Visual Perception (SLAM/Computer Vision)
- Generative AI (LLMs/VLA)

Students will learn to navigate these heavy computational loads effectively.

## Assessment Philosophy

Our approach to assessment emphasizes:
- **Project-based learning** where students build increasingly complex systems
- **Simulation-to-reality** transfer, testing algorithms in both environments
- **Iterative development** with continuous testing and validation
- **Collaborative problem-solving** on complex robotics challenges

## Hardware and Software Requirements

This course is technically demanding, requiring:
- High-performance workstations with RTX GPUs for simulation
- NVIDIA Jetson kits for edge deployment
- Access to humanoid robot platforms (various options available based on budget)

## The Capstone Project

The quarter culminates in a comprehensive project where students develop an **Autonomous Humanoid** system that can:
- Receive voice commands using natural language
- Plan and execute navigation paths
- Identify and manipulate objects
- Respond intelligently to environmental changes

This project integrates all major components learned throughout the quarter, providing a comprehensive demonstration of Physical AI principles in action.

## Beyond the Classroom

The skills developed in this course prepare students for emerging fields including:
- Assistive robotics for healthcare and eldercare
- Industrial automation with human collaboration
- Research in embodied AI and cognitive robotics
- Development of social robots for education and entertainment

## Integration with Industry Standards

Throughout the course, we emphasize industry-standard practices and technologies:
- ROS 2 for robot communication and control
- NVIDIA Isaac for AI-powered robotics
- Agile development methodologies for robotics projects
- Safety considerations for human-robot interaction

This approach ensures that students graduate with skills immediately applicable in industry and research settings.
